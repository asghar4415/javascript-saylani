//DOM
//DOM is a tree of nodes and each node is an object representing a part of the document.
//DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
//The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.


console.log(document);
console.log(document.childNodes);
console.log(document.childNodes[1].childNodes);
